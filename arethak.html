Her deep understanding of social and political dynamics is reflected in her paintings, which often depict the struggles, triumphs, and everyday lives of people within the diaspora. Her debut exhibition, “Diaspora Dreams,” showcases her ability to merge complex themes with striking visual narratives, creating a powerful commentary on identity and belonging.</p>
